# Repo-Explorer
- This is my solution to the SilverOrange screening assignment.
- Thanks for the learning opportunity!

## React App notes
- React App expects the API server at localhost:4000 (see [./hooks/useApplicationData.tsx](./hooks/useApplicationData.tsx))

## Also important to know
- As a new developer who just graduated from Bootcamp the assignment took me much longer than 4 hours.
- Typescript was not part of the schooling program and I haven't had exposure to it, hence the poor use of it.
